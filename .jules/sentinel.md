### Issue: Burn Permit Location Not Falling Back to Permittee's Address when Empty or "--"

**Context:** The `api/process_email.php` script extracts burn permit details from incoming emails. If the "Address of Burn Location" is missing, the email template sometimes provides `--`.
**Problem:** The string `--` evaluated as truthy in PHP, which caused the script to use `--` as the primary address instead of correctly falling back to the permittee's home address (`$person_address`). This caused mapping and display issues on the dashboard.
**Resolution:** Updated the condition to `!empty($burn_location_address) && trim($burn_location_address) !== '--'`. The fix was applied to both the initial regex extraction assignment and the Gemini API fallback assignment. A unit test was also added to ensure this edge case doesn't regress.
**Learning:** When parsing text inputs or human-formatted emails, do not assume that empty fields will be strictly empty strings (`""`) or `null`. Fields might contain visual placeholders like `--` or `N/A`, which need to be explicitly evaluated.
